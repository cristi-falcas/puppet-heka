# Produces more human readable alert messages.
# It uses the sandboxencoder
#
# === Parameters: none
#
# $preserve_data::                True if the sandbox global data should be preserved/restored on plugin shutdown/startup.
#                                 When true this works in conjunction with a global Lua _PRESERVATION_VERSION variable which
#                                 is examined during restoration; if the previous version does not match the current version
#                                 the restoration will be aborted and the sandbox will start cleanly. _PRESERVATION_VERSION should
#                                 be incremented any time an incompatible change is made to the global data schema. If no version
#                                 is set the check will always succeed and a version of zero is assumed.
#
# $memory_limit::                 The number of bytes the sandbox is allowed to consume before being terminated (default 8MiB).
#
# $instruction_limit::            The number of instructions the sandbox is allowed to execute during the
#                                 process_message/timer_event functions before being terminated (default 1M).
#
# $output_limit::                 The number of bytes the sandbox output buffer can hold before being terminated (default 63KiB).
#                                 Warning: messages exceeding 64KiB will generate an error and be discarded by the standard output
#                                 plugins (File, TCP, UDP) since they exceed the maximum message size.
#
# $module_directory::             The directory where 'require' will attempt to load the external Lua modules from. Defaults to ${SHARE_DIR}/lua_modules.
